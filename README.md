Experiments in simulating nuclear power plants.

## Why

For a long time I've wanted to play with a nuclear power plant simulator, and I have memories of a program like this from my childhood (real or imagined, I'm not sure).  I started this project because I thought it would be even more fun to play with a physical simulation, so the plan is to design a simplified operator console to provide a tactile interface to a reactor simulated in software.
